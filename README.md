# hyprix's new website
hyprix's website

the website: https://hypriii.github.io
old website: https://ziko.neocities.org (it redirects you to the new one)

i cant kinda code so credits to @undrscre for some half of the code :)

# why did i port it to github pages?
neocities got blocked in my country, i'm tired of my vpn turning on and off, so here it is!

# why did you not update the website about me redirect to the real website?
hey stop asking!!! btw because i'm lazy.
